## When to Log a "Close"

A trial venue becomes **"closed/won"** when:
1. Venue owner/manager agrees to $299/month plan
2. Stripe billing details are set up
3. First paid month begins
4. Subscription status changes from `trial` to `active`

**Tracking:** Log in CRM with date, venue name, primary closer name, and Month 1/2/3 payment status.

## Commission Rules

**Per Venue Closed (Trial → Paid):**
- Pure Dev (Tech Lead, Product/UI Lead): **CAD $100/month × 3 months**
- Hybrid Dev: **CAD $100/month × 3 months**
- Business/Growth co-founder: **CAD $100/month × 3 months**

**Commission Trigger:**
- Venue converts to paid $299/month
- Primary closer is logged in CRM
- Commission paid monthly if venue is still active

## Common Objections & Responses
