## Slide 2: The Problem

**Bars Are Missing Out on a $40B+ Opportunity**

**The Pain:**
- Midweek revenue is flat despite proven demand
- Live entertainment (trivia/games) can lift revenue **20–65%**
- Professional hosts cost **$200–300/night** and don't scale
- Existing tools fail in loud, high-turnover bar environments
- **No analytics**: Owners can't measure ROI

**The Market:**
- 650,000+ bars in North America
- $40B+ annual bar industry
- **20–40%** of revenue from events/entertainment
- Validated demand: **35 players at Christie's Pilot**

**Visuals:**
- Empty bar vs. packed bar with game night
- Revenue lift chart: 20% → 65%
- Cost breakdown: $200/night host vs. $299/month platform

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Social: Host-Less Games Platform**

**What We Built:**

1. **Top Comment** (Twitter Parody Social Voting)
   - QR join → team play → submit roasts → vote → leaderboard
   - $1.50 per play
   - Engagement: 40+ plays/night = $60 revenue

2. **VIBox** (AI Jukebox)
   - QR join → vibe picker (chill/hype/party) → Suno generates AI track
   - $2.00 per song
   - Queue display on TVs + patron engagement
   - Venue keeps all patron revenue

**How It Works for Bars:**
- Setup: 5 minutes
- Operation: Bartender taps "Next"
- Monetization: 100% of patron revenue goes to venue
- Zero professional hosts needed

**Visuals:**
- Split screen: "For Venues" vs. "For Players"
- QR code flow diagram
- Real-time leaderboard screenshot
- Song generation animation

## Slide 4: Traction & Validation

**Built in Bars, Validated with Real Players**

**Pilot Results:**
- **Christie's Carriage House Pub:** 35 players, 2-hour engagement
- **Revenue Math:** 40 Top Comment plays ($60) + 20 VIBox songs ($40) = **$100/night proof**
- **Player Retention:** 100% round completion, instant <10-second join

**Pipeline:**
- **6 additional venues** actively pursuing pilots:
  - Felicita's, Swans, Phoenix Bar & Grill
  - Grad House, Smuggler's Cove, Spinnakers

**Why This Works:**
✅ Purpose-built for bars (noise-tolerant, bartender-friendly)
✅ Fast onboarding (no apps, no accounts)
✅ Monetized (patrons pay, venues keep revenue)
✅ Real-time analytics (engagement, revenue, dwell time)
✅ Scalable architecture (two games in 12 weeks)

**Visuals:**
- Christie's photo + player engagement timeline
- Comparison table: Social vs. competitors (Jackbox, DIY, paid hosts)
- Metrics cards: 35 players, 2 hours, 100% completion

## Slide 5: Business Model

**High-Margin SaaS with Clear Unit Economics**

**Venue Pricing:**
- **Pro Plan:** $299/month (unlimited scans, both games)
- 14-day free trial with library lock-in
- Venues keep 100% of patron revenue

**Patron Revenue Per Venue/Month:**
- Top Comment: 40 plays × $1.50 × 30 days = **$1,800**
- VIBox: 20 songs × $2.00 × 30 days = **$1,200**
- **Total: $3,000 patron revenue** (venue keeps 100%)
- Server tips: +$45/shift (Social gets 40%)

**Financial Projections:**
- **Week 4:** 5 venues → $1.5k MRR
- **Week 12:** 59 venues → $44k MRR (projected)
- **Year 1:** 100+ venues → $100k+ ARR
- **Gross margins:** 85%+ (infrastructure costs only)

**Unit Economics:**
- CAC: $0 (community-driven pilots)
- Churn target: <5%
- Trial conversion target: 70%

**Visuals:**
