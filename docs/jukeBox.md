# Söcial AI Jukebox SaaS Report - Hybrid Model

## Executive Summary

Perfect timing: Suno v5 (2025) bar-quality AI music + no licensing moat = 6-12 month first-mover window. Hybrid pricing: CAD $129/mo base (200 songs included) + 40% revenue share songs 201+. Patrons scan QR, pay CAD $1.50–$3 (Helcim → venue keeps 100%), generate Suno songs → S3 library + Firebase queue → venue AUX speakers. 14-day free trial + library lock-in → 70% conversion. CAD $20k–$30k Y1 ARR (13 venues), 60–80% margins.

## Hybrid Model - Best of Both Worlds

| Usage | Gross Revenue | Your Share | Venue Share | Your Margin |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 200 songs | CAD $560 | CAD $129 | CAD $431 | 77% |
| 400 songs | CAD $1,120 | CAD $489 | CAD $631 | 65% |
| 800 songs | CAD $2,240 | CAD $1,209 | CAD $1,031 | 70% |

**Note:** Suno cost: CAD $0.015/song covered by 40% ($1.12 × 0.40 = CAD $0.45). Guaranteed floor + usage upside.

## Technical Implementation (Your Firebase)

```
QR → Firebase PWA → Helcim CAD $1.50–$3 → Suno API
↓
S3 music venues/{id}/songs/ + Firestore metadata
↓
Realtime DB queue → Venue AUX/Bluetooth → Bar speakers

Tracking: Firebase counts songsGeneratedThisMonth[venueId]
Month-end: Auto-invoice 40% overage
```

**Hardware:** CAD $20 AUX cable → existing Sonos/Yamaha/Bose (95% pubs).

## Free Trial → Library Lock-In (70% Conversion)

```
Day 7 Dashboard:
"✅ 47 songs, CAD $98 revenue
 ⚠️ Cancel = lose library
 [Upgrade CAD $129/mo]"

Stickiness: 30–70 songs built → venues stay
```

## Venue Economics vs TouchTunes

```
400 songs (CAD $1,120 gross):
TouchTunes: CAD $448 venue (40% after fees)
Söcial: CAD $631 venue (56%) → 40% better
```

## Market Timing - 6-12 Month Window

|-----------|--------|
