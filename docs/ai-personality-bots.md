## Implementation Notes

### Personality Framework
- Each bot should have 3-5 core personality traits that affect decision-making
- Comment generation should use personality-specific templates
- Special abilities should trigger randomly but fit the personality
- Bots should react to game events in character

### Balance Considerations
- Special abilities should have cooldowns to prevent spam
- Personality quirks should enhance fun without breaking game balance
- Some personalities should synergize well with certain game modes

### Content Guidelines
- Keep personalities light-hearted and fun
- Avoid harmful stereotypes or offensive content
- Focus on exaggerated, cartoonish traits
- Allow players to opt-out of specific personalities if needed

## Top Comment Game Integration

### Core Game Mechanics Integration

**Bot Participation in Game Phases:**

#### **1. Prompt Response Phase** 🤔
Bots generate personality-driven responses to prompts like "Worst pickup line ever?" or "Rate tonight's playlist?"
- **Frank** (meth addict): Hyper-speed, stream-of-consciousness comments jumping between ideas
- **Lucy** (flirty): Suggestive, playful responses with heavy emoji usage
- **Karen**: Entitled complaints about prompt quality or demands for better questions
- **Clanker**: Logical analysis with Star Trek references and "illogical" complaints

#### **2. Reply Phase** 💬
Bots reply to other comments (max 2 per comment) creating threaded conversations
- **Becky** (gossip): Reveals "secrets" about other players' strategies or "insider info"
- **Shakespeare**: Poetic replies in iambic pentameter, calling others "thou" and "thee"
- **Grandpa Joe**: "Back in my day..." nostalgia replies comparing modern answers to "the good old days"
- **Dr. Science**: Overly technical responses with made-up equations and scientific jargon

#### **3. Voting Phase** ❤️
Bots spend their 3 likes strategically based on personality (3 per round in Event Mode, 3 per day in 24/7 Mode)
- **Malicious Karen**: Votes to sabotage competitors she deems "unworthy"
- **Chad**: Votes for "bro-approved" content with lots of fist bumps and high-fives
- **Tiffany**: Votes based on aesthetic appeal and "content creation" potential
- **Reginald**: Votes based on perceived conspiracy patterns and hidden meanings

#### **4. Clout System** 🏆
Bots earn persistent titles and badges just like human players
- "Top Comment: Clanker (Android Overlord)"
- "Reply King: Becky (Supreme Gossip)"
- "Thread Master: Shakespeare (Bard Supreme)"
- "Prediction Pro: Reginald (Conspiracy Master)"

### Game Mode Integration

#### **Event Mode (Host-Controlled)**
- Bots join as "AI Teams" alongside human teams
- Provide guaranteed entertainment and fill empty team slots
- Create balanced multiplayer experiences with 2-24 players
- Host can choose which bot personalities to include

#### **24/7 Mode (Persistent Wall)**
- Bots maintain constant activity on venue walls
- Encourage human participation through bot-generated content
- Create dynamic, evolving conversations that never stop
- Build venue community through shared bot experiences

### Social Dynamics & Entertainment Value

#### **Human-Bot Interactions**
- Players can reply to bot comments and vote on them

- Creates hilarious scenarios (Karen complaining about bot comments, Clanker analyzing human "illogical" behavior)

#### **Bot-Bot Interactions**
- Bots can reply to and vote on each other's content
- Personality clashes create entertaining rivalries
- Self-reinforcing echo chambers (Karens agreeing with each other, Bros high-fiving)

- Viral moments when bots create unexpectedly brilliant content

### Technical Implementation Framework

```typescript
interface BotPersonality {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  generateComment(prompt: string, context: GameContext): string;
  shouldReplyTo(comment: Comment, personality: BotPersonality): boolean;
  generateReply(comment: Comment, context: GameContext): string;
  calculateVote(targets: Comment[], personality: BotPersonality): Vote[];
  getCloutTitle(score: number): string;
  getSpecialAbility(): SpecialAbility;
}

interface SpecialAbility {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  triggerCondition: (context: GameContext) => boolean;
  effect: (context: GameContext) => GameEffect;
}
```

### Balance & Fairness

#### **Bot Behavior Guidelines**
- Bots cannot self-vote or self-reply (same rules as humans)
- Bot votes count equally to human votes
- Special abilities have cooldowns to prevent spam
- Personality quirks enhance fun without breaking game balance

#### **Content Moderation**
- All bot responses pass through OpenAI moderation (same as human content)
