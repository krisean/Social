# Executive Summary – Social Game Engine

**Team:** Social Game Engine (4 UVic Co-Founders)
**Date:** December 2025
**Target:** $44k MRR from 59 Victoria venues by Week 12

---

## 1. Problem & Opportunity

Bars rely on weekly programming to drive traffic, increase dwell time, and create repeat visits. Trivia and game nights are proven levers—industry studies show successful events can lift midweek revenue by 20–65% and draw 30–50+ players staying 2+ hours.

**The Challenge:**
- Professional trivia hosts cost $200–$300/night and don't scale (four venues = $3,200+ monthly cost)
- Consumer games (Jackbox, quiz apps) fail in loud, high-turnover bar environments
- Most bars lack analytics to measure ROI on entertainment programming
- **Market gap:** $40B+ US bar industry, 650,000+ venues, 20–40% from events—but no scalable solution exists

**Our Validation:**
Christie's Carriage House Pub pilot: **35 players, 2-hour engagement, immediate pricing interest** (November 2025)

## 2. The Solution: Social

**Social** is a B2B SaaS platform ($299/month) powering **two host-less bar games** via QR codes.

### **Top Comment** (Week 1)
- Twitter-parody social voting game
- QR join → anonymous team → submit creative answers → vote on favorites → live leaderboards
- **$1.50 per play**
- Engagement: 40 plays/night = $60 venue revenue

### **VIBox** (Week 4)
- AI jukebox powered by Suno API
- QR join → vibe picker (chill/hype/party) → AI generates track → plays to venue speakers
- **$2.00 per song** (covers Suno cost)
- Engagement: 20 songs/night = $40 venue revenue

### **Key Benefits:**
✅ **Host-less:** One bartender, one button—no professional entertainer needed
