# Auto-Generated Documentation

This directory contains documentation files automatically generated by AI assistants during development.

## Purpose

- **Analysis Results**: Code analysis, architecture reviews, and technical assessments
- **Migration Reports**: Database migrations, framework updates, and refactoring summaries
- **Implementation Notes**: Feature implementations, bug fixes, and technical decisions
- **Project Documentation**: Automatically generated project overviews and status reports

## Organization

Files are typically named with timestamps or descriptive prefixes:
- `analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Code analysis results
- `migration-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Migration reports
- `implementation-summary.md` - Implementation documentation
- `architecture-review.md` - Architecture assessments

## Maintenance

- Files in this directory are automatically generated
- Manual edits should be avoided (regenerate instead)
- Outdated files can be safely deleted when no longer needed
- Consider moving important content to main documentation directories
