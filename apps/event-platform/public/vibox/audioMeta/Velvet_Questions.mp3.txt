--- Track Information ---
Title: Velvet Questions
Artist: ProgressiveDarkstep727
Year: 2026

--- Musical Information ---

--- Creation Details ---
Prompt: jazz, Smoky cinematic jazz with a sly, creeping bass line, brushed kit, and noir piano chords. Female vocals glide in low and close, like a secret in your ear, with muted trumpet replies in the gaps. The groove stays soft but coiled, tension building through subtle string swells and chromatic moves; choruses bloom with stacked whispers and reverb tails that hang in the air. Perfect under dialogue, but strong enough to feel like a character in the room.

--- Lyrics ---
[Instrumental]
