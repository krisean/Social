# Side Bets client

React + TypeScript + Vite app powering the Side Bets party game.

## Available scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # start local dev server
npm run build    # typecheck and build for production
npm run lint     # run ESLint (if configured)
```

Configuration lives in `.env.local` (or `.env`) via `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values. Copy `client/.env.example` to get started and keep real keys out of version control.

See the repository root `README.md` for full setup instructions.
